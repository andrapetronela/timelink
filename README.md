What is the Challenge?
Build a startup landing page that actually works! Start off by reading this excellent article: https://medium.com/@timferriss/how-to-create-a-million-dollar-business-this-weekend-examples-appsumo-mint-chihuahuas-fae4dab10842 Then, go through the Bootstrap 4, Templates, And Building Your Startup Landing Page in the Zero to Mastery course if you need a refresher. You will need to build a landing page with your business product being showcased, and an email signup form. This email form should be signed up to something like Mailchimp(https://mailchimp.com/). which will allow you to collect user emails to see how many people are interested in your product. You will now have a way to test your idea and see if people like it! Remember: the idea can be silly. You will be judged on the website, not on the product or how valid of an idea it is. Have fun with it.

The Rules Are:
You HAVE TO use two things from Creative Tim - Starter Project: https://github.com/timcreative/udemy-nuk and the NOW UI Kit: https://www.creative-tim.com/product/now-ui-kit. You will use those to start off the project but you can customaize or add to it whatever you like afterwards. Be creative.

You have until August 30th at 11:59pm EST to submit your solution file (using Github. If you don't know how to do that, check out the lecture in the Git + Github section of the course). You will have to submit the link to the #coding-challenge Discord group with the following message: -challenge github.com// . The bot will listen for the command in any channel its in and will reply with "thanks for your submission" if it succeeded. Winner will be announced a couple of weeks after the contest ends.

Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and build something that will be challenging. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team.
